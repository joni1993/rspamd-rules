# There is no reason to shorten and hide the address of a website with
# a "URL shortener". Usually only spammers do that.
#
# Unfortunately, RSpamd does not support the detection of a domain in an
# image tag and the list "list.url.shortener.map" cannot be used.
#
# At some point in the future there will be a solution with a LUA script.
