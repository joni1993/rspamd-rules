# ==============================================================================
# Many of the possible top level domains (TLD) are only used by spammers.
# We do not allow these TLDs.
#
# Unfortunately, RSpamd does not support the detection of a TLD in an image tag
# and the list "list.tld.map" cannot be used.
#
# At some point in the future there will be a solution with a LUA script.
