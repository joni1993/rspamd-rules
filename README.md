## rspamd-rules - Curated Multimaps and Rules for Rspamd

*Rspamd* works quite well out-of-the-box, but it needs some tweaking and many additionaly rules.

Without parsing emails against phrases more than 70 percent of incoming spam mails wouldn't be recognized.

Rspamd offers so called **Multimaps** and their **Maps**.

Based on different categories like *Scam*, *Phishing*, *Health* and many others, i created a few rules.

To be honest, I haven't understood everything yet. That's why not all rules work as desired and there are probably still bugs.
