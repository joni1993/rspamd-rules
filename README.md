## rspamd-rules - Curated Multimaps with Rules for Rspamd

Even in 2023 an accurate content filtering is the last resort of a spam filtering system.

Rspamd offers so called **Multimaps** and their **Maps**. This allows with or without regex to create any rule we want.

As i did it in *Declude* i created maps related to different categories mostly for two languages.

:boom: **The rules will be updated on a daily base.** :boom:

🍀 Feel free to use these maps on your Rspamd server.

To be honest, I haven't understood everything yet and therefore not every rules is perfect.
Sometimes it is hard to understand the documentation for me.
:bulb: That is a good reason to start a [Wiki](https://github.com/martinschaible/rspamd-rules/wiki).
