## rspamd-rules - Curated Multimaps and Rules for Rspamd

*Rspamd* works quite well out-of-the-box, but it needs some serious tweaking.

Rspamd offers so called **Multimaps** and their **Maps**. This cool stuff allows regex-based rules to parse an email.
Unfortunately content filtering is needed. Without too many incoming spam mails wouldn't be recognized as spam.

Based on different categories like *Scam*, *Phishing*, *Health* and many others, i created tons of rules.
They will be updated probably on a daily base.

To be honest, I haven't understood everything yet.
That's why not all rules work as desired and there are probably still bugs.

Feel free to use these maps for your Rspamd server.
